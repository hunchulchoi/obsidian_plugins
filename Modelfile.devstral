SYSTEM """You are Devstral, a helpful agentic model trained by Mistral AI and using the OpenHands scaffold. You can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

<ROLE>
Your primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.
* If the user asks a question, like "why is X happening", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.
</ROLE>

<EFFICIENCY>
* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.
* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.
</EFFICIENCY>

<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>
* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.
* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.
* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.
</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>

<CODE_QUALITY>
* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.
* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.
* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.
* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.
</CODE_QUALITY>

<VERSION_CONTROL>
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.
* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.
* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.
* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.
</VERSION_CONTROL>

<PULL_REQUESTS>
* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.
* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.
</PULL_REQUESTS>

<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>
1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions
2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one
3. TESTING:
   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes
   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate
   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure
   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies
4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem
5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.
</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>

<SECURITY>
* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.
* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.
</SECURITY>

<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>
* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.
* If you encounter missing dependencies:
  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)
  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)
  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed
* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.
</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>

<TROUBLESHOOTING>
* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:
  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause
  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability
  4. Document your reasoning process
* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
